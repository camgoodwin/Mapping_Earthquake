# Mapping_Earthquake
# Overview: 
Creating an earthquake map that has three different type of map layouts.  These three different types of maps are a street view, satellite view, and a dark view.  We are also creating overlays to the map that show the earthquakes, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes. 

# Results: 
We can see that where the tectonic plates lay have a relation to the amount of earthquakes occur in that area. 

# Summary: 
The website is well organized and clearly labeled with the ability to change the view as needed. Images of the layouts are clearly displayed within the main branch of this repository.
